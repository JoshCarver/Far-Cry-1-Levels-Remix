Download and extract the compressed level folders. 
Once extracted, copy each of the 6 level folders into FarCry/Levels folder. 
Launch the game. 
To access the levels: open console (default tilde key) and type "\map 1st" "\map 2nd" "\map 3rd" "\map 4th" "\map 5th" "\map 6th" for each level respectively.
At the end of each level, the command to load the next level must be executed otherwise the next default/vanilla map in sequence will load. 
Enjoy!
